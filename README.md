# SC2-genome-curation

This site hosts the scripts needed to curate SARS-CoV-2 consensus genomes produced in part with our Institut Pasteur of Madagascar collaboration. Consensus genomes are produced from a Nexflow pipeline on [IDseq.net](IDseq.net) after upload of raw .fastq files from Next Generation Sequencing. The scripts stored here can be run on the resulting IDseq output, manually curated, then uploaded to GISAID.org.

Step-by-step instructions for genome curation are as follows:
