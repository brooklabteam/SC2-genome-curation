REM First, run copy-scripts.R to put copies of "sequence-pipeline.R" and "MN908947.3.fa" in each subdirectory

Rscript copy-scripts.R

REM then, loop over all these names to run your "sequence-pipeline.R" script within each subfolder

for /d %%d in (*) do (
    echo %%d
    cd %%d
    Rscript sequence-pipeline.R
    cd ..
)

REM then, once these finish, you can pull all of the newly generated tsv files into the parent file and concatenate them into one:

type nul > all_seq.tsv

@echo off
for /d %%D in ("%cd%\*") do (
    REM Loop through each .tsv file in the current directory
    for %%F in ("%%D\*_all.tsv") do (
        echo Processing file: %%F
        type "%%F" >> all_seq.tsv
    )
)

REM note that this will concatenate the header multiple times, so you will need to remove it in the next step where you link to metadata (with Ct) and generate rpm plot with another R script.

Rscript merge-meta-plot.R

REM from here, take the output script "seq_check_manual.csv" and the .bed files of the locations for the Ns and the ambiguous bases and manually check them in Geneious. Once completed, generate an edited consensus genome file and use it in the final R script to compare again against the reference and generate final files, including a composite mutation tracker.
